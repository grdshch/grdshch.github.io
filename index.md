## What is BMI?

The [body mass index (BMI)] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index) is a measure of relative weight based on an individual's mass and height.

The BMI is usually used as a simple method to assess how much an individual's body weight departs from what is normal or desirable for a person of his or her height.

## Calculating BMI

BMI is defined as the individual's body mass divided by the square of their height â€“ with the value universally being given in units of kg/m2.

<br>
$$BMI = \frac{mass(kg)}{(height(m))^2}$$
